	<li>Find a gif that is compelling to you</li>
	<li>Create a document with a colour that compliments your chosen gif</li>
	<li>Create a rectangle that is about a quarter the height of your screen and about two thirds the width of the screen</li>
	<li>Place it along the bottom of the screen and give it white dashes on the top and bottom egdes</li>
	<li>Within the rectangle, create 5 squares lined up horizontally, each with slightly rounded corners</li>
	<li>Select 5 frames from the gif you chose and place one inside each of the 5 squares</li>
	<li>Create a thin vertical line that repeatedly runs along the width of your larger rectangle placed at the bottom of your screen, timed to the length of one loop of your gif</li>
	<li>Make a larger square above the rectangle on the bottom of your page and place your gif inside, and allow your gif to play only when the user hovers over this large square</li>
